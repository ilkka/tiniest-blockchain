# Tiniest Blockchain

This is an implementation of [the Tiniest Blockchain](https://medium.com/crypto-currently/lets-build-the-tiniest-blockchain-e70965a248be) by [Gerald Nash](http://www.aunyks.com/), in Elixir, ported as best I know how by [github.com/ilkka](https://github.com/ilkka). This is a vehicle for me to learn Elixir better, mostly.

## Usage

I'm only up to the middle of the second article in the series so... :D Anyway, I guess this will have an HTTP interface that you can call to post transactions. Annnnd... probably some method for synchronising state. More on that later.
